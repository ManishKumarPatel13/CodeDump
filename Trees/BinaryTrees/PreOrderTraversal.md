# Preorder Tree Traversal in Java

## Introduction

In computer science, a binary tree is a data structure that stores data in a hierarchical manner. Each node in the tree can have a maximum of two child nodes, one on the left and one on the right. A preorder tree traversal is a type of tree traversal that visits the root node first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree. This process is repeated recursively for each subtree.

## Implementation

The following Java code implements a preorder tree traversal:

```java
public class PreorderTraversal {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a binary tree
        Node root = new Node(1);
        root.left = new Node(2);
        root.right = new Node(3);
        root.left.left = new Node(4);
        root.left.right = new Node(5);

        // Perform a preorder traversal of the tree
        preorderTraversal(root);
    }

    public static void preorderTraversal(Node node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Visit the root node
        System.out.println(node.data);

        // Visit the left subtree
        preorderTraversal(node.left);

        // Visit the right subtree
        preorderTraversal(node.right);
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The `main` method creates a binary tree with the following structure:

        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7

2. The `preorderTraversal` method is called with the root node of the tree as an argument.

3. The `preorderTraversal` method checks if the root node is null. If it is, the method returns.

4. The `preorderTraversal` method visits the root node by printing its data.

5. The `preorderTraversal` method calls itself with the left child of the root node as an argument.

6. The `preorderTraversal` method calls itself with the right child of the root node as an argument.

7. The `preorderTraversal` method returns.

Traversed tree will look like - 1 --> 2 --> 4 --> 5 --> 3 --> 6 --> 7

## Conclusion

Preorder tree traversal is a simple and efficient way to traverse a binary tree. It
