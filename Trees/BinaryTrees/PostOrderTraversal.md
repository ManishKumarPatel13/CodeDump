# Post Order Traversal in Java

## Introduction

In computer science, a binary tree is a data structure that stores data in a hierarchical manner. Each node in the tree can have a maximum of two child nodes, one on the left and one on the right. A post-order traversal of a binary tree visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, and then the root node.

## Code

The following Java code implements a post-order traversal of a binary tree:

```java
public class PostOrderTraversal {
    static node root;

    public static class node {
        public int data;
        public node right;
        public node left;

        node(int d) {
            this.data = d;
        }
    }

    public void PostOrderTraversal(node r) {
        if (r == null) {
            return;
        }
        PostOrderTraversal(r.left);
        PostOrderTraversal(r.right);
        System.out.print(r.data + " ");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PostOrderTraversal bt = new PostOrderTraversal();
        bt.initialize(1);
        node s = new node(2);
        node t = new node(5);
        node sl = new node(3);
        node sr = new node(4);
        root.left = s;
        root.right = t;
        s.left = sl;
        s.right = sr;
        bt.PostOrderTraversal(root);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

The code begins by defining a class called `node` that represents a node in a binary tree. The `node` class has three fields: `data`, `right`, and `left`. The `data` field stores the data value of the node, the `right` field stores a reference to the right child node, and the `left` field stores a reference to the left child node.

The next section of the code defines a method called `PostOrderTraversal`. The `PostOrderTraversal` method takes a reference to a `node` object as its argument and prints the data values of the nodes in the tree in post-order. The `PostOrderTraversal` method first recursively calls itself on the left child node of the current node. Then, it recursively calls itself
