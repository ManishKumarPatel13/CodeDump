 ## Queue Using Array in Java

### Step-by-Step Explanation

A queue is a data structure that follows the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added to the queue (front) will be the first one to be removed (rear). Queues are often used in scenarios where items need to be processed in the order they were received.

In this code, we have implemented a queue using an array. The `queue` class has the following attributes:

* `size`: The maximum size of the queue.
* `arr`: The array that will store the elements of the queue.
* `insert`: The index of the next element to be inserted into the queue.
* `delete`: The index of the next element to be removed from the queue.

The constructor of the `queue` class takes the size of the queue as an argument and initializes the `arr` attribute with an array of that size.

The `enqueue` method adds an element to the queue. If the queue is not full, the element is added to the end of the array and the `insert` index is incremented. If the queue is full, the method returns an error message.

The `dequeue` method removes an element from the queue. If the queue is not empty, the element at the front of the queue is removed and the `delete` index is incremented. If the queue is empty, the method returns an error message.

The `isEmpty` method checks if the queue is empty. It returns `true` if the `insert` and `delete` indices are both -1, and `false` otherwise.

The `isFull` method checks if the queue is full. It returns `true` if the `insert` index is equal to the size of the array, and `false` otherwise.

The `printQueue` method prints the elements of the queue from front to rear.

The `main` method creates a queue of size 30 and adds the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the queue. It then removes the first two elements from the queue and prints the remaining elements.

### Code Snippets

Here are some code snippets that illustrate the key concepts of the program:

```java
public class QueueUsingArray {
    public static class queue {
        public int size;
        public int[] arr = new int[size];
        public int insert = -
