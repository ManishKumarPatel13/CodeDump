# Insertion Sort

## Overview
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted array one element at a time. It is considered an "in-place" sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require any additional memory space beyond the original array.

The basic idea behind insertion sort is to divide the input array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. The sorted part is initially just the first element of the array, and the unsorted part contains the rest of the elements. The algorithm then iterates through the unsorted part, taking one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.

## Implementation
The following Java code implements the insertion sort algorithm:

```java
public class InsertionSort {

    public static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {
        int l = arr.length;
        int element, j;
        for (int i = 1; i < l; i++) {
            element = arr[i];
            j = i - 1;
            while (j >= 0 && element < arr[j]) {
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
                j = j - 1;
            }
            arr[j + 1] = element;
        }

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] ar = {3, 5, 2, 4, 7};
        insertionSort(ar);
        for (int i = 0; i < ar.length; i++) {
            System.out.print(ar[i] + " --> ");
        }
    }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Explanation

The following is a step-by-step explanation of how the insertion sort algorithm works:

1. The algorithm starts by considering the second element of the array (index 1) as the current element to be inserted.
2. The current element is compared to the elements in the sorted part of the array, moving from right to left.
3. If the current element is smaller than the element being compared, the compared element is moved one position to the right.
4. This process continues until the correct position for the current element is found in the sorted part of the array.
5. The current element is inserted into its correct position in the sorted part
