# In python list you can store mulitple data types together like you can have a list of integers and string combined but in 
# numpy array you can only make a array for a specific datatype 

# numerical operations works faster in numpy array and all matrix operations are very convenient in numpy array

# Modification is less in numpy array

# np array consumes less memeory and works faster
